## Study Summary 
The impact of common environmental exposures in combinations with socioeconomic and lifestyle factors on cancer development, particularly for young adults, remains understudied.  In this study, we leveraged comprehensive environmental and cancer incidence data collected in New York State to examine the impact of 31 exposures on 10 main cancers (i.e., lung and bronchus, thyroid, colorectal, kidney and renal pelvis, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia for both sexes; corpus uteri and female breast cancer; prostate cancer), for three age groups (25 – 49, 50 – 69, and 70 – 84 year-olds).  For each cancer, we stratified by age group and sex, and applied regression models to examine the associations with multiple exposures simultaneously. The models included 642,013 incident cancer cases during 2010-2018 and found risk factors consistent with previous reports (e.g., smoking and physical inactivity). Models also found positive associations between ambient air pollutants (ozone and PM2.5) and prostate cancer, female breast cancer, and melanoma of the skin across multiple population strata. In addition, the models were able to better explain the variation in cancer incidence data among 25 – 49 year-olds than the two older age groups. These findings support the impact of common environmental exposures on cancer development, particularly for younger age groups.

## Data
This folder includes compiled data on cancer incidence rates and environmental exposures in NYS\
The cancer incidence data were compiled from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) program (data released in April 2022)\
The environmental exposures were compiled from multiple sources as detailed in Table S1
